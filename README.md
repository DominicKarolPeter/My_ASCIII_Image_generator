# my image to ascii converter
I have just done the basic stuff now . It just converts an image given to it to asci according to the luminosity of the pizels and comparing that to a given sequence of characters.
I will make the process more optimal by integrating some algorithm to fasten the process of converting pixel to respective character according to their value .
